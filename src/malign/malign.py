    ==========
    seqs : list of iterables
        A list of iterables (lists, tuples, or strings) representing the sequences to
        be aligned.
    method : str
        The method to be used for alignment computation. Currently supported methods are
        `"dumb"`, `"anw"` (for "asymmetric Needlemanâ€“Wunsch"), and `"yenksp"` (for
        the graph-alignment based on Yen's k-shortest paths algorithm).
    matrix :  dict or ScoringMatrix
        The matrix used for scoring the alignment. If provided, must match in length the
        number of sequences in `seq`. If not provided, an identity matrix will be created
        and used.
    k : int
        The maximum number of alignments to return. As there is no guarantee that the
        method being used or the sequences provided allow for `k` different alignments,
        the actual number might be less than `k`. Defaults to 1.
    gap : string
        The symbol to be used for gap representation. If `matrix` is a ScoringMatrix,
        it must match the gap symbol specified in it. Defaults to `"-"`.
