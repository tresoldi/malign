## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2025-10-16

### Added

#### Matrix Learning (Phase 2)
- **EM Algorithm**: Expectation-Maximization for learning scoring matrices from cognate sets
- **Gradient Descent**: L-BFGS-B optimization via `scipy.optimize.minimize`
- **Convergence Detection** (Phase 3.7):
  - Score-based convergence (relative change < 0.001)
  - Matrix-based convergence (Frobenius norm < 0.01)
  - OR logic: stops when either criterion is met
- **Early Stopping**: Patience-based stopping (default: 5 iterations without improvement)
- **Parameter Bounds**: Hard constraints [-10, 10] for gradient descent
- **Verbose Logging**: Optional convergence tracking with `verbose=True`

#### Serialization (Phase 2)
- **YAML Format**: Primary format for matrix serialization via `save()` and `from_yaml()`
  - Human-readable format with Unicode support
  - Handles asymmetric matrices and multiple domains
  - Preserves gap symbols and domain information
- **Builder Methods**: `ScoringMatrix.from_sequences()` for quick matrix construction

#### Metrics (Phase 2)
- **Alignment Accuracy**: Column-wise matching percentage
- **Precision/Recall**: Position-based evaluation metrics
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

#### Testing Infrastructure (Phase 3)
- **Coverage Tests**: Expanded from 74% to 77% on core malign.py
- **Property-Based Tests**: 6 core properties using Hypothesis
  - Alignment length consistency
  - Symbol preservation
  - Gap validity
  - Score monotonicity
- **Integration Tests**: 5 end-to-end pipeline scenarios
- **Regression Tests**: Validation against Arca Verborum gold standard (451,935 forms)
  - Baseline: 63% accuracy with identity matrix
  - Establishes performance benchmarks for future improvements
- **Benchmark Suite**: Performance analysis across sequence count, length, and k values
  - Documents 362x scaling for sequence count
  - Documents 2.7x scaling for sequence length
  - Documents 2x scaling for k value
- **Test Data**: 420 curated cognate sets from Arca Verborum
  - 100 regression test sets
  - 200 learning training sets
  - 100 learning evaluation sets
  - 20 integration test sets

#### Documentation
- **Algorithm Selection Guide**: Decision flowchart and performance comparison (ANW vs YenKSP)
- **Test Data Documentation**: Comprehensive `tests/data/README.md`
- **Pytest Markers**: `slow`, `integration`, `regression`, `property`, `benchmark`

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Function Renamed**: `multi_align()` â†’ `align()`
  - **Migration**: Replace all calls to `malign.multi_align()` with `malign.align()`
  - Signature and behavior unchanged
  - Return type always `List[Alignment]` (never single item)

- **Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.10+ (was 3.7+)
  - Uses modern type hints (`|` for Union, built-in generics)
  - Required for type annotation features

- **Docstring Style**: Migrated from Epytext to Google-style docstrings
  - More readable and widely adopted
  - Better tool support (Sphinx, IDEs)

#### Improvements
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive ruff linting and formatting applied
- **Type Annotations**: Added throughout codebase (mypy compatible)
- **Error Messages**: More descriptive validation errors
- **Performance**: Optimized matrix operations in learning algorithms

### Fixed
- **Sorting Issue**: Fixed None value handling in matrix score key sorting
- **Nested If**: Simplified conditional logic in gradient descent
- **Test Stability**: Fixed flaky integration tests with realistic timeouts

### Deprecated
- JSON matrix format (still supported for backward compatibility, but YAML is preferred)

### Performance Benchmarks

**Sequence Count Scaling** (ANW method):
- 2 sequences: 0.02s baseline
- 5 sequences: 7.22s (362x slower)
- Exponential scaling - use with caution for >5 sequences

**Sequence Length Scaling**:
- 5 symbols: 0.07s baseline
- 20 symbols: 0.19s (2.7x slower)
- Sub-quadratic scaling - practical up to ~50 symbols

**K Value Scaling**:
- k=1: 0.06s baseline
- k=20: 0.12s (2x slower)
- Nearly linear - k=50 is practical

**Learning Method Comparison** (Phase 3.8):
- **Gradient Descent**: 62.30% accuracy, slower (30s for 5 sets)
- **EM**: 13.85% accuracy with limited data, 481x faster (0.06s)
- **Recommendation**: Use gradient descent for better accuracy; EM needs more training data

### Migration Guide from 0.3.x

```python
# Old (0.3.x)
from malign import multi_align
alms = multi_align(sequences, k=3, method="anw")

# New (0.4.0)
from malign import align
alms = align(sequences, k=3, method="anw")

# Matrix learning (NEW in 0.4.0)
from malign import learn_matrix
cognate_sets = [[["ACGT"], ["AGCT"]], [["TGCA"], ["TGGA"]]]
matrix = learn_matrix(cognate_sets, method="em", max_iter=10)

# Use learned matrix
alms = align(sequences, k=3, matrix=matrix, method="anw")

# Save/load matrices (NEW in 0.4.0)
matrix.save("my_matrix.yml")
loaded = malign.ScoringMatrix.from_yaml("my_matrix.yml")
```

### Known Issues
- MyPy reports 105 type errors (documentation prioritized for beta release)
- Learning module coverage at 4.85% (tested via integration tests)
- Metrics module coverage at 8.00% (will improve in 0.4.0 final)
