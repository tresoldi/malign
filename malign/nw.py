    Perform pairwise alignment with the Asymmetric Needleman-Wunsch method.

    Parameters
    ==========
    seq_a : list
        The first sequence to be aligned.
    seq_b : list
        The second sequence to be aligned.
    matrix : dict or ScoringMatrix
        The matrix for the asymmetric scoring. Note that the order of the domains must
        follow the order of the sequences provided, that is, the matrix should be
        addressed with [seq_a_symbol, seq_b_symbol]. The implementation assumes the
        matrix has already been filled or will be automatically filled if
        necessary (with inference of missing values).
    gap : string
        The symbol to be used for gap representation. If `matrix` is a ScoringMatrix,
        it must match the gap symbol specified in it. Defaults to `"-"`.
    k : int
        Number of alignments to include in return. Note that is the upper limit, as it
        impossible to guarantee that there will be as many alignments as requested (due
        to both the sequences and the scoring matrix) and that this implementation of
        the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is not intended for collection of as many
        k-best alignments as possible (if so desired, the `yenksp` method is
        recommended). Defaults to `1`; if equal to `None`, all the collected alignments
        will be returned.
