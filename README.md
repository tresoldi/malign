MALIGN is a library for multiple asymmetric alignments on different alphabets.
It is currently under initial research and development, but can already be
used to obtain multiple alignments for DNA sequences.


## Installation and usage

The library can be installed as any standard Python library with
`pip`, and used as demonstrated in the following snippet:

In any standard Python environment, `malign` can be installed with:

```bash
$ pip install malign
```

For most purposes, it is enough to pass the two sequences to be aligned,
along with a scorer, to the `get_aligns()` function:


```python
>> import malign
>> seq1 = ["A", "T", "T", "C", "G", "G", "A", "T"]
>> seq2 = ["T", "A", "C", "G", "G", "A", "T", "T", "T"]
>> graph = malign.compute_graph(seq1, seq2, malign.DNA_SCORER)
>> dest = "%i:%i" % (len(seq1), len(seq2))
>> aligns = malign.get_aligns(graph, ("0:0", dest), seq1, seq2, 4)
>> for idx, align in enumerate(aligns):
>>   print(" ".join(align[0][0]), align[1])
>>   print(" ".join(align[0][1]), "\n")
A T T C G G A - - T 84.0
T A - C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A - - T 84.0
T - A C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A T - - 84.0
T A - C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A T - - 84.0
T - A C G G A T T T
```

The library can also be used by means of the command-line `malign` tool:

```bash
$ malign --dna ATTCGGAT TACGGATTT
Alignment #0 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A - - T
T A - C G G A T T T

Alignment #1 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A - - T
T - A C G G A T T T

Alignment #2 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A T - -
T A - C G G A T T T

Alignment #3 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A T - -
T - A C G G A T T T
```

## Changelog

Version 0.1:
  - First release for internal announcement, testing, and community outreach

## Roadmap

Version 0.2:
  - Setup readthedocs
  - Sort in consistent and reproducible way all alignments, even when the
    score is the same
  - Deal with conflicting package versions due to `lingpy`, or write new
    NW implementation
  - Implement single-pass function with defaults, with scorer, graph,
    destnation, etc.
