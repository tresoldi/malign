MALIGN is a library for performing multiple alignments on sequences of different
alphabets. It allows each sequence to have its own domain, which in turns allows to
use asymmetric and sparse scoring matrices, including on gaps,
and to perform real, single-pass multiple alignment, allowing to compute
`k`-best alignments. While intended for linguistic usage mostly, it can be used for aligning any type of
sequential representation, and it is particularly suitable as a general-purpose tool
for cases where there are no prior hypotheses on the scoring matrices.

## Installation and usage

The library can be installed as any standard Python library with
`pip`, and used as demonstrated in the following snippet:

In any standard Python environment, `malign` can be installed with:

```bash
$ pip install malign
```

For most purposes, it is enough to pass the two sequences to be aligned,
along with a scorer, to the `get_aligns()` function:


```python
>> import malign
>> seq1 = ["A", "T", "T", "C", "G", "G", "A", "T"]
>> seq2 = ["T", "A", "C", "G", "G", "A", "T", "T", "T"]
>> graph = malign.compute_graph(seq1, seq2, malign.DNA_SCORER)
>> dest = "%i:%i" % (len(seq1), len(seq2))
>> aligns = malign.get_aligns(graph, ("0:0", dest), seq1, seq2, 4)
>> for idx, align in enumerate(aligns):
>>   print(" ".join(align[0][0]), align[1])
>>   print(" ".join(align[0][1]), "\n")
A T T C G G A - - T 84.0
T A - C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A - - T 84.0
T - A C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A T - - 84.0
T A - C G G A T T T

A T T C G G A T - - 84.0
T - A C G G A T T T
```

The library can also be used by means of the command-line `malign` tool:

```bash
$ malign --dna ATTCGGAT TACGGATTT
Alignment #0 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A - - T
T A - C G G A T T T

Alignment #1 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A - - T
T - A C G G A T T T

Alignment #2 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A T - -
T A - C G G A T T T

Alignment #3 (score: 84.00)
A T T C G G A T - -
T - A C G G A T T T
```

## Changelog

Version 0.1:
  - First release for internal announcement, testing, and community outreach

Version 0.2:
  - Major revision with asymmetric Needleman-Wunsch and Yen's `k`-shortest path
    implementation.
  - Added scoring matrix object
  - Sort alignments in consistent and reproducible ways, even when the alignment
    score is the same

## Roadmap

Version 0.3:
  - Complete documentation and setup `readthedocs`
  - Add new inference method to sparse matrices using impurity/entropy
  - Describe matrix filling methods in more detail
  - Consider implementation of UPGMA and NJ multiple alignment
  - Add function/method to visualize the graphs used for the `yenksp` methods
  - Implement blocks and local search in `anw` and `yenksp`, with different
    starting/ending positions
  - Implement memoization where possible
  - Consider expanding dumb_malign by adding random gaps (`pad_align`), as an additional
    baseline method
  - Allow `anw` to work within a threshold percentage of the best score
  - Implement a method combining the results of the different algorithms
  - Add methods and demonstration for matrix optimization
